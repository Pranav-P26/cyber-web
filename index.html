        <h2>Data at Rest</h2>
        <p>
          Data at rest is a term used to describe all data in computer storage
          that is not currently being accessed or transferred. Examples of
          data at rest might include vital corporate files stored on the hard
          drive of an employee's computer, files on an External hard drive,
          data left in a storage area network (SAN) or files on the servers of
          an offsite backup service provider.

      </div>

        <img src="/static/assets/in_transit.jpg" alt="Data in Transit" />
        <h2>Data in Transit</h2>
        <p>
          Data in motion is data that is moving or being transferred between
          locations within or between computer systems. Data in motion may be
          moving within a computer system, over a wireless connection or along
          a wired connection. Data in motion should be encrypted in order to
          protect it from interception by hackers. Common forms of encryption
          for data in motion include encrypting the data before it is
          transmitted (while in a data at rest state) or encrypting the
          passage along which the data is sent.

        <img src="/static/assets/in_use.webp" alt="Data in Use" />
        <h2>Data in Use</h2>
        <p>
          Data in use is data that is currently being updated, processed,
          accessed and read by a system. Because data in use is directly
          accessible by one or more users, this is the state at which data is
          most vulnerable to attacks and when encryption is the most
          essential. Organizations protect data here by using encryption,
          authentication, and managing permissions to certain data. Some
          organizations also require an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) to
          further protect sensitive information.

  <!-- Authentication -->

    <h1>AUTHENTICATION</h1>
    <h3>How can we prove you're you?</h3>
    <div class="authentication-text-box">
      <p>Generally, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the
        entity requesting access is indeed who or what it claims to be. Authentication can be split into three
        categories:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="data-states-content">
      <div class="data-state">
        <img src="/static/assets/keycard.webp" alt="Something you have" />
        <h2>Something You Have</h2>
        <p>
          This includes all items that are physical objects, such as keys, smart phones, smart cards, USB drives, and
          token devices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="data-state">
        <img src="/static/assets/password.avif" alt="Something you know" />
        <h2>Something You Know</h2>
        <p>
          This includes passwords, PINs, combinations, code words, or secret handshakes. Anything that you can remember
          and then type, say, do, perform, or otherwise recall when needed falls into this category.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="data-state">
        <img src="/static/assets/fingerprint.jpg" alt="Something you are" />
        <h2>Something You Are</h2>
        <p>
          This includes any part of the human body that can be offered for verification, such as fingerprints, palm
          scanning, facial recognition, retina scans, iris scans, and voice verification.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="authentication-text-box">
        <p>Why stick to just passwords? Many organizations use multi-factor authentication to enhance security by
          combining two or more authentication methods. This means combining something you have, something you know, and
          something you are. While it may be tempting to use the most secure methods available, some methods may be more
          practical or user-friendly than others for different situations.</p>

    <div class="authentication-text-box">
      <p>Passwords are the keys to safeguarding your digital and online life. They are your first line of defense. Knowing how to create and store strong passwords is one of the most critical aspects of everyday cybersecurity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="password-panels">
      <div class="password-left-box">
      <h2>Password Guidelines for Maximum Security</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Long</strong>
          <p>Passwords should be at least 16 characters long. The longer your password, the longer it takes for hackers to crack it using brute force techniques. Right now, an eight-character password can be guessed in minutes by automated tools; a 16-character password can take a billion years to guess!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unique</strong>
          <p>Each account should have a unique password. Reusing passwords is common but risky. If one account is compromised, others become vulnerable. Small tweaks (adding a number or symbol) are often not enough; use entirely distinct passwords. A password manager can generate and store unique passwords for all your accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex</strong>
          <p>Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (like @, !, $). Some platforms allow spaces. The strongest passwords are long, random strings rather than identifiable words, names, or dates, and they should still meet the 16+ character recommendation.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="password-right-box">
      <h2>Why you should use a password manager</h2>
      <p>Our advice about unique, strong, and complex passwords probably seems overwhelming if you've never used a password manager before. However, modern services can help you breathe a lot easier. Your password manager will become your favorite tool as you navigate the digital world. With a password manager, you only need to remember one master password to unlock your secure vault of stored passwords.</p>

      <h3>Benefits of using a password manager</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> No more struggling to remember dozens of passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> Automatically generate and store long, unique, and complex passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-saving:</strong> Browser extensions and smartphone apps autofill credentials for quick and secure logins.</li>
        <li><strong>Safe vaults:</strong> High-quality password managers use encryption and zero-knowledge architecture, making them safer than notebooks, sticky notes, spreadsheets, or reusing passwords.</li>

          <h3>AOHell</h3>
          <p>Back in early 1994, a malicious program called AOHell was developed by a Pennsylvania teenager and was intended to crack America Online (AOL) accounts.</p> <br>
          <p>Among other things, the program ran on top of the AOL client, stealing user's passwords and using the program's credit card generator to create fake accounts, which they would then use to impersonate AOL customer service. Regular users were asked to verify their accounts for security purposes, making this arguably the earliest form of phishing.</p>

          <h3>RSA</h3>
          <p>In 2011, the United States' defense suppliers were breached when security firm RSA fell victim to spear phishing due to an Adobe Flash vulnerability.</p><br>
          <p>Disguised as recruitment plans for that year, the email targeted mid-level employees with just one line of text: "I forward this file to you for review. Please open and view it.". Only one employee had to open the email for phishers to gain backdoor access on the victim's desktop. The phishers then managed to bypass the company's SecurID two-factor authentication to steal company data.</p>

          <br><p>At the same time, a handful of rental scams were reported as well.

      <h2>Why Social Engineering Is So Dangerous</h2>
      <div class="authentication-text-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <p>Social engineering is attractive to cybercriminals because it enables them to access digital networks, devices and accounts without having to do the difficult technical work of getting around firewalls, antivirus software and other cybersecurity controls.</p>
        <p>According to ISACA's State of Cybersecurity 2022 report, social engineering is the <strong>leading cause of network compromise today</strong>. IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report found that breaches caused by social engineering tactics were among the most costly, and phishing is the leading malware infection vector, identified in 41% of all incidents.</p>
        <p>In a larger organization, it takes just one employee's mistake to compromise the integrity of the entire enterprise network. This is why security awareness training combined with robust cybersecurity policies is essential for every organization.</p>
